## AltSchool-Africa---My-First-Semester-Project-
### This is my first project on Github - Food Ordering Application.
#### This project is a simple food ordering system that allows users to select items from a menu, specify the quantity, and add them to a cart. The system calculates the total price for each item and provides a summary of the order at checkout. It simulates an interactive user experience, offering real-time feedback, such as confirming items added to the cart and showing the final order details with total pricing.
